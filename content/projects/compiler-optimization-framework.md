## Abstract

This research project explores advanced compiler optimization techniques based on static single assignment form. The framework implements several novel optimization passes that leverage SMT solving for more aggressive constant propagation.

## Approach

The optimizer uses a three-phase design:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Constructs control flow and data dependency graphs
2. **Transformation Phase**: Applies optimization passes in a specific order
3. **Verification Phase**: Uses Z3 to verify optimization correctness

### Novel Contributions

- **SMT-guided constant folding**: Uses Z3 to prove value ranges and enable more aggressive optimizations
- **Context-sensitive loop unrolling**: Analyzes loop invariants to determine optimal unroll factors
- **Speculative dead code elimination**: Proves unreachability using SMT constraints

## Preliminary Results

On the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite, the framework achieves an average 8% performance improvement over baseline LLVM -O3, with specific workloads showing up to 23% gains.

## Limitations

Current implementation is limited to straight-line code and simple loop structures. Exception handling and function pointers require additional analysis passes.
