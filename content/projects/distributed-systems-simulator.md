## Overview

This project implements a discrete-event simulation framework for distributed systems research. It allows researchers to model and test consensus algorithms, replication strategies, and failure recovery mechanisms in a controlled environment.

## Key Features

- **Deterministic replay**: All network events are logged and can be replayed for debugging
- **Fault injection**: Programmable network partitions, message delays, and node crashes
- **Multiple consensus protocols**: Built-in implementations of Raft, Paxos, and EPaxos
- **Visualization**: Real-time graph visualization of cluster state and message flow

## Technical Details

The simulator uses a priority queue-based event scheduler to maintain causal ordering of events. Network behavior is modeled using configurable delay distributions and partition scenarios.

### Performance

On a modern laptop, the simulator can process approximately 50,000 events per second, making it practical for testing systems with hundreds of nodes over extended simulated timeframes.

## Future Work

- Integration with TLA+ specifications for formal verification
- Support for Byzantine fault tolerance protocols
- Distributed tracing integration
