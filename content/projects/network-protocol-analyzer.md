## Overview

A zero-copy packet capture system built using eBPF and XDP for analyzing network traffic at line rate. The tool can decode multiple protocol layers and detect anomalous traffic patterns in real-time.

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

### Capture Engine (eBPF/XDP)

Kernel-space packet filtering and metadata extraction with minimal overhead. The eBPF program runs directly in the network driver, allowing sub-microsecond packet processing.

### Protocol Decoder

User-space decoder supporting common protocols:
- Ethernet, IPv4/IPv6, TCP/UDP
- HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, gRPC
- DNS, TLS 1.2/1.3
- Custom protocol plugins via Lua scripting

### Analysis Pipeline

Stream processing pipeline that maintains connection state and applies statistical anomaly detection using sliding window algorithms.

## Performance Characteristics

- **Throughput**: 10Gbps on commodity hardware
- **Latency**: < 100μs packet-to-analysis delay
- **Memory**: Constant memory usage regardless of traffic volume

## Use Cases

This tool has been used for:
- Network troubleshooting and debugging
- Security monitoring and intrusion detection
- Application performance analysis
- Protocol compliance testing
